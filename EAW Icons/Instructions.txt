This is a quick guide on how to setup and use your own custom launchers for steam mods with Empire At War

DONT FORGET!!!-make sure you clear any existing launch options from your properties area of the game in steam. Leaving it may cause issues. 

1. Select Empire at War from your Steam game library
2. Select properties > installed files > browse
3. Select corruption.
4. In here you should see swfoc.exe, copy the path to this. It should look something like this F:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Star Wars Empire at War\corruption\swfoc.exe
5. Gather your mod launcher ID's
	Thrawn's Revenge = STEAMMOD=1125571106
	Fall of The Republic = STEAMMOD=1976399102
	Revan's Revenge = STEAMMOD=3417277973
6. For each mod you want to create a shortcut for do the following
	1. Create the link for you mod. Place the path of your executable in quotes and append your mod's ID Like so, "F:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Star Wars Empire at War\corruption\swfoc.exe" STEAMMOD=1125571106
	2. Right click on your desktop and select New > Shortcut
	2. In the window paste your newly created path and mod link
	4. Give your shortcut a name. I recommend the name of your mod like Thrawn's Revenge. Hit Save.
	5. For custom icons right click on your new shortcut and select properties
	6. Select change icon
	7. Browse to the icons from this pack, or select your own
	8. Select your icon and save it

Repeat these steps for each mod you which to create a shortcut for.
For multiple mods on launch it should work the same way as on steam where you do multiple mods separated by a space.
